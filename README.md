# NBA-Draft-2022-Fantasy-Stats
Fantasy Stats per game and per minute compiled based on sports.ws scoring.

For this project, I compiled the stats of all 2022 NBA draft prospects, including prospects from college, overseas, G-League Ignite, and even one player's (Shaedon Sharpe), EYBL high school AAU stats,  and converted their stats to sports.ws fantasy league scoring, including points per game (FPPG) and points per minute (FPPM).

Although roles and productivity change with the transition into the NBA, this is a good indicator of which prospects are efficient in their minutes on the court, which is vital to the league setup of sports.ws fantasy.
